2. Mode-Specific System

A. Dark Mode (The "Deep Midnight" System)
Optimized for high-energy, cinematic AI video environments.
Surface (Background): #1A1A2E — Deep Midnight Blue. Provides more depth than pure black.
Surface Elevated: #252545 — Use for cards, modals, and dropdowns.
Primary Text: #FFFFFF — Pure White for maximum readability.
Secondary Text: #A9ADC1 — Muted Lavender-Gray for metadata and captions.
Accent Glow: #6DE8EC — Use with low opacity (15%) for "glow" effects behind avatars or buttons.
Alert/Action: #FF4D4D — Coral Red for critical errors or "Delete" actions.

B. Light Mode (The "Ghost White" System)
Optimized for productivity, dashboards, and heavy reading.
Surface (Background): #F8F9FF — Ghost White (slight blue tint to reduce eye strain).
Surface Elevated: #FFFFFF — Pure White for cards to pop against the background.
Primary Text: #1A1A2E — The Dark Mode background color repurposed as text.
Secondary Text: #626D85 — Slate Blue-Gray for secondary labels.
Accessibility Accent: #00B5BD — A deepened version of your Cyan for UI icons and secondary links.
Alert/Action: #E63946 — Crisp Red for visibility on bright surfaces.



3. Interaction States (Hues & Tones)
For a polished 2025 feel, use these mathematical adjustments for UI interactions:
Hover (Primary): #6F3DD1 (10% Darker than #8652E2)
Active/Pressed: #5A2BB1 (20% Darker)
Disabled State: #E0E0E0 (Light Mode) / #33334D (Dark Mode)

4. Visual Hierarchy & Implementation
To maintain a D-ID "Creative Reality" aesthetic, follow these rules:

The 60-30-10 Rule:
60% Neutral: Deep Midnight (Dark) or Ghost White (Light).
30% Primary: Amethyst Purple for sidebars or primary buttons.
10% Accent: Electric Cyan for progress bars, toggle switches, or active icon states.
Avatar Placement: When displaying AI avatars generated via D-ID, use the Dark Mode palette background. It provides a "theatrical" contrast that makes the video content look higher quality.
Gradients: For a modern touch, use a linear gradient from your Primary Purple to your Secondary Cyan at a 135-degree angle for hero sections or premium feature buttons.

The "Glass" Layer: Use a white or very light purple fill at 10%–15% opacity with a high Background Blur (20px to 40px).
The Border: Add a subtle border using your Cyan (#6DE8EC) at 30% opacity to make the card edges "catch the light".
The Glow: Place soft, large circles of your Purple (#8652E2) deep in the background, behind the glass cards, to create a sense of floating objects.
